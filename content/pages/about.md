## Graduate Student Organization

### In collaboration with the [Cultural Studies Program](https://www.culturalstudies.pitt.edu), GSWS graduate certificate students have formed a joint GSO (CGGSO). The [CGGSO](https://www.gsws.pitt.edu/academics/graduate-studies/graduate-student-organization) works closely with the leadership of both programs to shape and publicize opportunities for graduate students.

Currently, the CGGSO organizes a dissertation writing group, a works-in-progress series, and an annual graduate students symposium of Cultural Studies & Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies. For information, email **cggso@pitt.edu**.

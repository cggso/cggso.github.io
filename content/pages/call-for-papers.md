This year we are looking for papers by graduate and undergraduate students that address the theme of this year’s symposium: **“Renewing Connections: How the Past Informs the Present.”** The adage, “If we ignore the past, we are bound to repeat it,” defines many of the threats to human rights that are occurring all over the world. What are the implications? What can be done? What should we be doing to prevent further infringement of rights for people all over the world? The CGGSO wants to highlight your work and give you an opportunity to be a part of the conversation and to help generate ideas that answer these questions. We are looking for work that uses a Cultural Studies or Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies lens. We invite all perspectives, methodologies, and topics related to this
year’s theme.
